# Udon Audio Tools
Udon Audio Tools constains a collection of audio reltated scripts/components for UDON/Udon Sharp based VRChat worlds.

Everything here is work in progress and may evolve with time.

Note: Components still called 'Better-' will be renamed to reflect the name change of the Repository!

Currently released are only the BetterPlayerAudio parts.

You can find the v0.8 release here: https://github.com/Guribo/BetterAudio/releases/tag/BPAv0.8
>*In order to use it you need the VRChat Udon SDK, [UdonSharp by Merlin](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/wiki/setup) and Unity 2019.4.*
>*Afterwards simply import the v0.8 unitypackage and have a look at the example scene `Assets/Guribo/UdonBetterAudio/Examples/PrivateZones/PrivateZones.unity`.*

**Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Guribo/BetterAudio/wiki) for additional information on the available components, features and prefabs.**

It contains:
- player voice control
- private channels
- player voice/avatar audio occlusion
- player voice/avatar audio directionality
- reverb filter support

A second version the focuses on audio effects in worlds will be released later, the code already includes:
- speed of sound
- sonic booms
- doppler effect
- occlusion
> *Due to the specifically targeted usecase (fast vehicles/objects) there is not much use for it currently and is also quite expensive in terms of performance.
> Thus it is not released yet but you are free to donwload the code from the development branch and give it a go.*
